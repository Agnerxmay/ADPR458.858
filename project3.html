            <p>My life changed when I made better choices: for me and my family.</p>
            <p>Just like the average person, I was eating all sorts of unhealthy, processed and artificial food. But something amazing happened when I tried a plant-based diet that incorporated a daily juice: I had more energy, lost weight, and just generally feel fantastic. I also recovered faster from my second caesarean section delivery than the first one. My husband joined me on my juice journey, and he lost more than 15 kg in total, thanks to juicing and the lifestyle changes we have made. After that, there was no going back.</p>
            <p>My experience in 2013 drove me to start experimenting with my own juice recipes. At first it was just sharing juices & its benefits to family & friends. And then, it’s to reach out to as many people as possible –- launching La Juiceria as a way of providing more people with healthy options.</p>   
            <p>From our humble online store to juice bars, healthy cafes and the spin-off of new brands & services, my mission stays the same – to give better options  to people.</p>    
            <p>Quality over quantity. Make better choices, one day at a time. You can change your destiny.</p>
            <p>It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped.– Tony Robbins</p>
